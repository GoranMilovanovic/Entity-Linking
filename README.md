# Entity-Linking
Entity Linking against Wikidata

**Description. ** These notebook is a part of discussion with [Martin Gerlach](https://martingerlach.github.io/about/) of [Wikimedia Research](https://research.wikimedia.org/) on the possibility of performing fast and computationally efficient entity linking from [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) pages to [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page). **Such an approach, if possible to develop, would help improve our understanding of the distributive semantics of Wikipedia (e.g. by enriching the data sets used in topic modeling), and could serve as a basis of a recommendation system for what new internal links should be included in the existing Wikipedia pages**.
